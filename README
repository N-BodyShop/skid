	main.c
	kd.c
	kd.h

	grav.h
	smooth1.c
	smooth1.h

For detailed information read the man page (either cat1/skid.1 or
man1/skid.1). A small demo of a 32768 particle input file has 
been included, just type demo after building skid. The demo input
is in the XDR standard binary format and is converted to a NATIVE
tipsy binary file by totipnat. The program totipnat is one of several
file conversion and other tools in a package called tipsy_tools which
is part of the TIPSY distribution.
